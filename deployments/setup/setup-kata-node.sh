# Adds a Kata Containers node to the EXISTING k3d cluster by joining a REAL (non-Docker) k3s
# agent directly to it — NOT by creating a k3d node container. (`make setup-kata` / this script.)
#
# Why not a k3d node container (like setup-gvisor-node.sh does for gVisor): Kata needs a real
# glibc/systemd/journald Linux node with /dev/kvm. A k3d node is a minimal container, and even
# with /dev/kvm passed through from the host, Kata's host<->guest vsock handshake hits walls a
# real host doesn't have (missing glibc loader, /dev/log, vhost_vsock — confirmed via live
# testing, see deployments/kata-isolation-tier.md §9: k3d cannot boot a Kata VM, full stop).
# Rather than throwing away the whole cluster and reinstalling everything on a bare host, this
# script does the SAME thing `k3d node create` does under the hood for gVisor (run `k3s agent`,
# joined to the existing server) — just without the Docker wrapper, so the resulting node is a
# genuine host. The k3d server (and every runc/gVisor agent already running) is untouched.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Pulls the join token + reachable address off the running k3d server container.
#   2. Installs k3s as a bare systemd agent on THIS host, version-matched to the cluster.
#   3. Verifies /dev/kvm is present directly on the host (no container nesting in the way).
#   4. Wires this node into the k3d-only bits that k3d normally provisions automatically for
#      its own node containers, but never touches for an externally-joined node: the
#      `host.k3d.internal` DNS alias (used by the in-cluster workflow-plane registry) and the
#      registry mirror config (`/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml`) — without these, image pulls
#      for anything built by the workflow plane fail with "no such host" / TLS errors.
#   5. Hands off to install-kata.sh (the production kata-deploy path) with this node as the
#      target — which also auto-detects and wires k3s's containerd (see install-kata.sh).
#
# This is a DEV/TEST tool for exercising the Kata tier locally. It is NOT what a real customer
# would do — a production cluster wouldn't have `host.k3d.internal` at all, and would just run
# install-kata.sh directly against its own real nodes.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Must run on the SAME host as the k3d cluster's Docker daemon (uses `docker exec`/`docker
#     inspect` against the k3d server container directly).
#   - Host has /dev/kvm (nested virtualization) — e.g. a GCP VM created with
#     --enable-nested-virtualization on an Intel N2 machine.
#   - curl, docker, kubectl, helm available.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run — skips k3s install if already joined, skips /etc/hosts /
# registries.yaml changes if already present.
#
# Usage:  make setup-kata    (or:  ./setup-kata-node.sh)
